Setting up test ng has two steps 

1.testNG plugin with eclipse 
Open the eclipse  click on help then click on install new software testng link which is I copied from google 
and paste the link work with -https://dl.bintray.com/testng-team/testng-eclipse-release/  then click on add 
and showing TestNg select all and click on next review the page n click on next then finish is ready for work 
.
2. testNG jar file . ( download link jar = https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.testng/testng/6.10).
After install the testng go to the  eclipse create a Java project -create a library folder- then copy 2 selenium jar and testNg jar paste on library – add all of build path – now is ready for use selenium and TestNg.
Good to Go…..


TestNg Structure :  

//this is how we creat a funtion  = public void setupTest(){}

//Annotation -sequence (@Before,@After,@Test is called annotation).

//sequence is called what ever im doing in scripts like bellow :


@BeforeTest 
public void setupTest(){


}

@Test 
public void mainTest(){


}


@AfterTest 

public void AfterTest(){


}


BeforeTest - excutes one time before all the test .
AfterTest - excutes one time After all the test .

1 class - is 1 test script.


1 test scripts can have multiple test or test cases like :


@Test 
Public void aTest(){

}

@Test 
Public void bTest(){

}


@Test 
Public void cTest(){

}

if we have multipale test in a 1 test Scripts the test will be excute  by alphabitcal orders (a,b,c,d,e) 
or 
we can setup  pioritoy (0),pioritoy (1),pioritoy (2) etc.
 


if i want to excute something Before or after test we have to annotation 
			
@BeforeMethod -
@AfterMethod -
